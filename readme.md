# 🚀 PLASTIVIZE

**Your AI Guide to a Greener Planet**

## 📖 Project Description

PLASTIVIZE is an AI-powered application designed to help users identify, recycle, and creatively reuse plastic waste. It transforms your device into a powerful tool for environmental action, making sustainability accessible and engaging.

### ✨ Problem Statement
Plastic pollution is a critical global issue. Many individuals want to contribute positively but lack accessible tools to identify different plastic types, understand local recycling rules, and discover practical ways to reduce their waste. This knowledge gap often leads to improper disposal, contaminating recycling streams and increasing landfill burdens.

### 💡 Proposed Solution
PLASTIVIZE provides a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that leverages the Google Gemini AI to bridge this information gap. By simply taking a photo, users can:
- **Instantly Identify Plastics:** Classify plastic types (PET, HDPE, etc.) and get immediate data on recyclability, decomposition time, and carbon impact.
- **Track Environmental Impact:** A personal dashboard visualizes positive contributions, such as CO₂ saved and items diverted from landfills, and rewards users with achievements.
- **Calculate and Reduce Footprint:** An integrated calculator helps users understand their plastic consumption and offers actionable, AI-generated tips for reduction.
- **Discover Reuse Ideas:** The app provides creative DIY tutorials and ideas to upcycle plastic waste into useful items.
- **Explore Global Data:** An interactive 3D globe visualizes plastic waste data, offering a worldwide perspective on the issue.
- **Engage with a Community:** Users can join challenges, compare progress on leaderboards, and feel part of a collective effort.

### 🎯 Target Users / Use Cases
- **Eco-Conscious Individuals:** People actively looking to reduce their environmental impact and make sustainable lifestyle choices.
- **Families & Households:** Parents teaching children about recycling and managing household waste more effectively.
- **Students & Educators:** A tool for learning about material science, environmental impact, and data visualization.
- **DIY & Craft Enthusiasts:** Users looking for inspiration and materials for upcycling projects.
- **Local Communities:** A platform for organizing recycling drives and community-based environmental challenges.

## 🔬 Methodology

1.  **Research & Ideation:** Analyzed the primary barriers to effective recycling for individuals and brainstormed AI-driven features to address them.
2.  **Design:** Created wireframes and a complete UI/UX design focused on simplicity, engagement, and a positive user experience. Architected a scalable frontend and robust backend integration with the Gemini API.
3.  **Develop:** Implemented core features using a modern tech stack, including the AI-powered scanner, user dashboard, footprint calculator, and interactive globe.
4.  **Test:** Conducted usability testing to refine the user flow and ensure the accuracy and reliability of the AI-powered analyses.
5.  **Deploy:** Hosted the application for live demonstration and user access.
6.  **Future Scope:** Plan to introduce features like local recycling facility locators, brand sustainability scores, and an expanded marketplace for recycled goods.
